Greetings, Cyber Defenders! I’m a driven cybersecurity specialist and a relentless continuous learner with a BSc in Computer Science. With a couple of years of solid network security experience and a broader IT background, I’m all about growth—constantly adapting and developing new ways to hunt and mitigate threats. Eager for growth and always on the lookout for the next big thing, I’m excited to bring my skills and energy to the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity!

## Objective
My journey in computer science has ignited a deep passion for cybersecurity, driving me to transition into this field with a focus on becoming a Tier 1 Analyst in a Security Operations Center (SOC). I aim to leverage my solid experience in network security and ongoing cybersecurity education to excel in threat detection, response, and analysis. Eager to contribute to a proactive security team, I’m committed to growing my skills and enhancing my expertise in a dynamic SOC environment.


## Projects

- [**SOC Automation Lab: Detection and Response with LimaCharlie, Tines, TheHive, Wazuh, and Sysmon**](https://github.com/Ennygee/SOC-Automation-Lab-Detection-and-Response-with-LimaCharlie-Tines-TheHive-Wazuh-and-Sysmon)  
  Integrated LimaCharlie (EDR), Tines (SOAR), TheHive (case management), Wazuh (SIEM), and Sysmon (monitoring) to automate SOC operations for detecting and responding to threats in real-time.

- [**Cloud-Based SOC Automation Lab with Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle**](https://github.com/Ennygee/Cloud-Based-SOC-Automation-Lab-with-Wazuh-TheHive-and-Shuffle)  
  Developed a cloud-based SOC automation lab utilizing Wazuh for security monitoring, TheHive for case management, and Shuffle for incident response automation.

- [**Dynamic Threat Detection Lab: Reverse Shells, Telemetry, and SIEM Analysis**](https://github.com/Ennygee/Dynamic-Threat-Detection-Lab-Reverse-Shells-Telemetry-and-SIEM-Analysis)  
  Created a lab focused on detecting reverse shells through telemetry analysis using SIEM tools, enhancing threat detection and mitigation capabilities.

- [**GoPhish Phishing Simulation Lab: Facebook Credential Capture**](https://github.com/Ennygee/GoPhish-Phishing-Simulation-Lab-Facebook-Credential-Capture)  
  Executed a phishing simulation using GoPhish, focusing on Facebook credential capture. Analyzed the results to improve phishing detection and employee security awareness.

- [**Virtual AD Lab: Domain Controller and Client Setup with 1,000 Users**](https://github.com/Ennygee/Virtual-AD-Lab-Domain-Controller-and-Client-Setup-with-1-000-Users)  
  Configured a fully functional Active Directory (AD) lab with 1,000 users in a virtual environment. Automated user creation and management with PowerShell scripts.

- [**Blue Team Operations Lab: Active Directory Threat Detection with Splunk, Sysmon, and Atomic Red Team**](https://github.com/Ennygee/Blue-Team-Operations-Lab-Active-Directory-Threat-Detection-with-Splunk-Sysmon-and-Atomic-Red-Team)  
  Developed an Active Directory security lab that integrates Splunk for log analysis, Sysmon for monitoring, and Atomic Red Team for attack simulations to practice blue team threat detection techniques.
